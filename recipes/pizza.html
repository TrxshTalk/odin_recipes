    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Buffalo-style pizza. Characterized by a light, fluffy, almost focaccia-like crust, 
    <br>a semisweet sauce, copious amounts of mozzarella cheese and exclusive use of cup-and-char pepperoni.</p>
    <p>It has a distinct tangy and spicy taste that you can adjust depending on your preference: mild, medium, 
    <br>or hot. You can either enjoy it as an appetizer or pair it with a cup of steaming white rice.</p>
