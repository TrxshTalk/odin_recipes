    <h1>Buffalo-Style Pizza</h1>
    <img src="./pizza.jpg" alt="pizza image">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Buffalo-style pizza. Characterized by a light, fluffy, almost focaccia-like crust, 
    <br>a semisweet sauce, copious amounts of mozzarella cheese and exclusive use of cup-and-char pepperoni.</p>
    <p>It has a distinct tangy and spicy taste that you can adjust depending on your preference: mild, medium, 
    <br>or hot. You can either enjoy it as an appetizer or pair it with a cup of steaming white rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the Sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the Pizza:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough</li>
        <li>1 pound low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3 ½ ounces thick pepperoni slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add tomato paste, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, basil, 
        <br>oregano, salt, and sugar. Saute until the tomato paste starts to caramelize on the bottom of the pan, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in water and whisk to combine; bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, 
        <br>until the sauce reduces to your desired thickness. Turn off the heat and reserve until needed.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Generously grease a sheet pan with olive oil, rubbing some on your fingers as well.</li>
        <li>Press, stretch, and pull pizza dough until it fills the prepared pan, going all the way to the corners. If the dough stops stretching, 
        <br>let it rest for 5 minutes before resuming.</li>
        <li>Top dough with cooled sauce, spreading all the way to the edges of the pan. Sprinkle on mozzarella cheese and add pepperoni. 
        <br>Place the pan on the stove over a high flame, and slowly move it around to evenly apply the heat, 
        <br>until you hear it starting to sizzle, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Transfer into the lower center of the preheated oven and bake until cheese is beautifully browned and pepperoni is charred, 
        <br>about 20 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
