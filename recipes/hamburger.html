    <h1>Juicy Hamburger</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>No more dry, lackluster hamburgers. These are juicy, and spices can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>½ cup crushed saltine crackers or Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set out a large mixing bowl. Add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, 
        <br>milk, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Mix by hand until the meat mixture is smooth, 
        <br>but stop once the mixture looks even. (Overmixing can create a dense heavy texture.)</li>
        <li>Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger 
        <br>patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>
        <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather 
        <br>the patty mix and press firmly into patties. Shape them just slightly larger than the buns you plan 
        <br>to use, to account for shrinkage during cooking. Set the patties on the baking sheet. Use a spoon to 
        <br>press a dent in the center of each patty so they don't puff up as they cook. If you need to stack the 
        <br>patties separate them with a sheet of wax paper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat. (Approximately 350-400 degrees F.)</li>
        <li><strong>For thick patties:</strong> Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li><strong>For thin patties:</strong> Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stack the hot patties on hamburgers buns, and top with your favorite hamburgers toppings. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Homemade hamburger patties will keep well tightly wrapped in plastic wrap or in an airtight container in 
    <br>the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
